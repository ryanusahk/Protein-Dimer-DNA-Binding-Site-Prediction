Protein-Dimer-Genome-Binding-Site-Prediction
============================================

Python script that takes inputs of a standard GenBank Genome file and a known DNA binding site and predicts the binding sites of dimerized proteins in the upstream region of all known open reading frames of genes. Outputs a file for viewing in standard UGene software.

#Included Files
##bindingsites.py
##NA1000.gb
The Annotated Caulobacter Genome file which the script is set to import. Can be replaced with any standard annotated GenBank .gb file.
